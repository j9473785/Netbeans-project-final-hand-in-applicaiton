welcome to my application , the sole focus of it is to teah peoople how to use nmap commands to scan their network. This will be achieved through a quesiton and answer
method. There will also be a risk assessment chart that will allow the user to upload their  NMAP results , that they have learnt from the applicaiton . In additon
to this there is also a CVE API that will show the user what threats our out there .
